What is PHPShell
==
PHPShell is foremost a pet project I make in late evenings.
It is also a wannabe shell for your browser based on PHP, it is compact and comes in a single file (So you could use it for PoC pentesting etc. but seriously, there is better stuff out there)

Interactive support
==
While PHP-shell technically isnt an interactive shell it does have somewhat interactive support
